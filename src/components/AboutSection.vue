        Actuarial Studies and Computer Science. But perhaps a more apt description would be an
        newbie statistician who has stumbled into the rabbithole that is JavaScript and software

        I aspire to one day combine my experience in data processing and implementing modern machine
        learning and algorithmic technologies to build software that enhances natural language
        processing and makes communication across languages more seamless and accessible.

        is another one of my all time favourite video games. I have recently also starting picking
        up the electric guitar.
